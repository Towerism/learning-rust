## About this repository

You don't need anything to read the code in this repo, OBVIOUSLY. But if you
want to compile and run them, you will want to install the Rust toolchain. Go
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) for more information about
that.

## About these programs

Each directory contains a rust program. To run any given program, simply `cd`
into its corresponding directory and run `cargo build` followed by `cargo run`.
